    Calculate the value of each industrially-produced productive Stock that
    is used up and add this to the value of self.sales_stock.

    Add the used-up size of each socially-produced productive Stock to 
    the value of self.sales_stock.

    Once Production and Reproduction are both complete, recalculate
    unit values and prices and then revalue all Stocks from their sizes.

    This is a separate calculation and is not done inside production,
    because it can only calculated after Social Classes have restored
    their sale_stocks. This applies in particular to Labour - but a 
    value-creating function can be assigned to any Social Class to study 
    the consequences of a theory which asserts that it provides a 'factor 
    of production' whether ficitious or not.
